Project Setup:

Frontend Setup:

The 'frontend' directory was navigated to.
Dependencies were installed using 'npm install'.
The frontend server was started via 'npm run start'.
Backend Setup:

The 'backend' directory was navigated to.
Necessary packages were installed with 'npm install'.
The backend server was launched using 'npm run start'.
Technology Stack Utilized:

Node.js and npm were leveraged.
Express.js was employed for API development.
Data was managed with MongoDB.
The jsonwebtoken library was utilized for JWT management.
Components and functionality were constructed with React.js.
Signup Screen Implementation:

Fields for email, password (with confirmation), and optional details such as name and profile picture were incorporated.
React's state management and validation libraries were employed for field validation and email format verification.
A checkbox for accepting terms and conditions was included.
Clear error messages and success notifications were provided.
A welcome email was simulated upon successful signup.
Redirection to the post list screen was implemented using React Router after signup completion.
Post List Screen Development:

A scrolling post list screen was developed that fetches data via a GET API.
Responsiveness and visual consistency with the "MelodyVerse" theme were ensured by utilizing Tailwind CSS.
API Endpoint Implementation:

A '/signup' endpoint was developed to handle user registration, ensuring data uniqueness and secure password hashing. A JWT token was returned upon successful registration.
A '/posts' endpoint was created for retrieving paginated post data from the database, with authentication checks.
JWT Implementation:

JWT tokens containing appropriate payload and expiration were generated upon successful login.
Token validation was implemented in protected routes to authenticate users.
Best Practices Followed:

Bcrypt was utilized for secure password hashing.
Comprehensive error handling was implemented to provide clear feedback.
Code was well-structured and documented throughout the project.
Environment variables were utilized to protect sensitive information.
Effective session management and token expiration handling were ensured.
Bonus Points Achieved:

Password reset functionality was successfully implemented.
Email verification for user signups was integrated.
Rate limiting was added to protect against brute force attacks.
Middleware was utilized for authentication and authorization purposes.
Social login options and password visibility toggle were implemented using mock APIs and React libraries.
